    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Biologically inspired swarming algorithms have seen significant development in simulation environments; however real-world experimental validation is essential for verifying their robustness, scalability, and performance under uncertainty. Simulation often abstracts away critical real-world constraints such as sensor noise, communication latency, hardware limitations, and unstructured environments. Experimental testbeds help bridge this gap, providing vital feedback on swarm theory and design.
    </p>

    <h2>Task</h2>
    <p>
      To increase accessibility to experimental swarm testbeds, I proposed building a swarm using commercially available Anki Vector robots. The Anki Vector is a compact differential-drive robot equipped with a camera, IMU, microphone, and accelerometer. The core research question is:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Can we build a real-world swarm system using commercially available robots in GPS-denied environments, relying purely on perception?
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We developed a centralized perception system to support the design of decentralized swarm behaviors.

      <li><strong>Fixed Landmark Localization</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Pose Estimation using Sensor Fusion</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Current Work:</strong> Multi-robot localization, scaling up system robustness and communication for larger swarms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>

    Built a robust real-time tracking pipeline to keep track of position and oreintaiton of Vector in 2D world coordinate system.
